# Email Notification Implementation Decision

## The Problem
EmailJS blocks API calls from backend servers (403 Forbidden error: "API calls are disabled for non-browser applications"). This is by design - EmailJS is meant for frontend use only.

## Your Options:

### Option 1: Use SMTP Email (Current Implementation)
**Pros:**
- Works even when users close tabs
- Professional email delivery
- Full control over email content/design

**Cons:**
- Requires email account setup (Gmail, etc.)
- Need app passwords for Gmail

**To use this option:**
1. Keep the current code
2. Add to your .env:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

### Option 2: Frontend-Only Email
**Pros:**
- Uses existing EmailJS setup
- No backend configuration needed
- Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- Only sends emails when user has the page open
- Won't work if user closes tab

**To use this option:**
Let me know and I'll revert to frontend-only implementation.

### Option 3: Use a Different Email Service
Services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES are designed for backend use.

**Pros:**
- Professional email delivery
- Better deliverability
- Detailed analytics

**Cons:**
- Requires account setup
- May have costs after free tier

## Recommendation
For production, I recommend Option 1 (SMTP) or Option 3 (Professional email service).
For quick testing, Option 2 (Frontend-only) works fine.
