# Post-Migration Database Schema Comparison

## Summary
After running the migration scripts, most schema differences have been resolved. Here's the current state:

## Brand Table Comparison

### ✅ Successfully Added Columns (All 8 columns are now present in production):
- `advantages` ✓
- `coreProduct` ✓
- `coreProductDetail` ✓
- `targetAudience` ✓
- `targetAudienceDetail` ✓
- `mainColor` ✓
- `selectedContentTypes` ✓
- `brandAnalysis` ✓

### Remaining Minor Differences:
1. **Column sizes**:
   - `name`: Production has varchar(100), Local has varchar(255)
   - `category`: Production has varchar(50), Local has varchar(255)
   - `url`: Production has varchar(500), Local has varchar(512)

2. **Collation**:
   - Production: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
   - Local: utf8mb4_unicode_ci

3. **Constraints**:
   - `fk_userId`: Production is NOT NULL, Local allows NULL

## Content Table Comparison

### ✅ Successfully Added Columns:
- `snsEvent` ✓
- `imageSize` ✓
- `additionalText` ✓

### ✅ Successfully Modified:
- `imageLog` changed from varchar(15) to TEXT ✓

### Note:
- Content table uses utf8mb3 charset (should be updated to utf8mb4)

## ContentRequest Table Comparison

### ✅ Successfully Modified:
- `directionList` expanded from varchar(25) to varchar(500) ✓

### ⚠️ Missing Column:
- `mainColor` - The ALTER statement may have failed silently

### Extra in Production:
- `status` column (keeping this as it may be used)

## Overall Status
The critical missing columns that were causing the "Unknown column 'advantages'" error have been successfully added. The brand creation functionality should now work properly.

## Recommendations
1. The minor differences in column sizes and collation are not critical
2. Consider updating content table charset from utf8mb3 to utf8mb4
3. Verify if contentRequest.mainColor was added successfully
